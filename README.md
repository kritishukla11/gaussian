**Gaussian**  
DFT (Density Functional Theory) workflow scripts and utilities

## Overview

This repository contains code and tools for performing *ab initio* quantum chemistry simulations using DFT. Currently supported workflows include:

- Converting `.xyz` molecular structure files to Gaussian job files (`.gjf`)  
- Basic automation and helper workflows for running Gaussian calculations
